# Asymmetric encryption and decryption using RSA

In this project, RSA encryption and decryption algotihm is implemented using C++. 
This repo is developled for the Discrete Mathematics class taken in Fall 2017


## How to use
* Execute ```
main.cpp```
### There are 4 text files :

#### 1. Plain file : This is where you enter your messege that you want to encrypt.
#### 2. Encrypted file : This is where the messege will be encrypted using RSA.
#### 3. Decrypted file : This is where the messege will be decrypted but still unreadable.
#### 4. Decrypted file finaloutput : This where the messege will return the same as the plain file.
