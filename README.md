# CIE308-Discrete-Maths---RSA-Ecryption-and-Decryption

Asymmetric encryption and decryption using RSA

There are 4 text files :
1- Plain file : This is where you enter your messege that you want to encrypt.
2- Encrypted file : This is where the messege will be encrypted using RSA.
3- Decrypted file : This is where the messege will be decrypted but still unreadable.
4- Decrypted file finaloutput : This where the messege will return the same as the plain file.
